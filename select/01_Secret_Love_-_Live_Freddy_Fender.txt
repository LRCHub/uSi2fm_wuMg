(1st Verse)
Wasted days and wasted nights,
I have left for you Behind
For you don't belong to me,
Your heart belongs to someone else.

(2nd Verse)
Why should I keep loving you,
When I know that you're Not true?
And why should I call your name,
When you're to blame
For making me Blue?

(Chorus)
Don't you remember the day,
That you went away and left me?
I was so lonely,
Prayed for you only,
My love.
