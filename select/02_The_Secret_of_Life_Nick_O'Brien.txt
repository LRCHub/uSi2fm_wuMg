The Secret of Life
(Love... love...)
It ain't money
It ain't about your job or the biggest house on the block
It ain't a flashy car
It ain't a hundred-foot yacht
It ain't about all you got... no
The secret of life is what we're all looking for
We all wanna know what's behind the other door
When it comes down to it, no I don't know much but I know

The secret of life is
A pretty girl with her hand in yours
And the kind of kiss yer living for
I swear there ain't no better buzz
The secret of life is/
Hanging out on a Friday night
Forever shining in her eyes
Don't let go cause that's the stuff the secret of life is
Love...
The Secret of life, secret of life is love.

It ain't college
It ain't a PhD
It ain't a pink umbrella on a white sand beach/
It ain't trophies or first-class coast to coast
And it ain't about the person who dies with the most - no

The secret of life is what we're all looking for
We all wanna know what's behind the other door
When it comes down to it, no I don't know much but I know
The secret of life is/
A pretty girl with her hand in yours
And the kind of kiss yer living for
I swear there ain't no better buzz
The secret of life is/
Hanging out on a Friday night
Forever shining in her eyes
Don't let go cause that's the stuff the secret of life is
Love... love
The Secret of life is love. Love...
The secret of life is, the secret of live is love

It ain't money
It ain't about your job or the biggest house on the block, no it's not
The secret of life is what were all looking for
We all wanna know what's behind the other door
When it comes down to it, no I don't know much but I know
The secret of life is/
A pretty girl with her hand in yours
And the kind of kiss yer living for
I swear there ain't no better buzz
The secret of life is/
Hanging out on a Friday night
Forever shining in her eyes
Don't let go cause that's the stuff the secret of life is
Love... love... ya the secret of life is, love... the secret of life, the secret of life is love
You know it is
