[01:35.12] Watch the sunrise
[01:37.76] Say your goodbyes, off we go
[01:45.37] Some conversation
[01:48.05] No contemplation, hit the road
[02:03.05] 
[01:55.36] Car overheats, jump out of my seat
[02:01.80] On the side of the highway, baby
[02:06.47] Our road is long, your hold is strong
[02:12.83] Please don't ever let go, oh no
[02:28.33] 
[02:17.41] I know I don't know you
[02:21.57] But I want you so bad
[02:28.15] Everyone has a secret
[02:31.52] Oh, can they keep it?
[02:34.60] Oh no, they can't
[02:43.10] 
[02:40.45] I'm driving fast now
[02:42.61] Don't think I know how to go slow
[02:50.97] Oh, where you at now?
[02:53.71] I feel around, there you are
[03:07.71] 
[02:59.46] Cool these engines, calm these jets
[03:01.78] I ask you how hot can it get
[03:04.79] And as you wipe off beads of sweat
[03:07.17] Slowly you say, I'm not there yet
[03:23.67] 
[03:12.10] I know I don't know you
[03:16.03] But I want you so bad
[03:22.51] Everyone has a secret
[03:25.81] Oh, can they keep it?
[03:29.18] Oh no, they can't
[03:37.68] 
[04:17.40] I know I don't know you
[04:21.65] But I want you so bad
[04:28.35] Everyone has a secret
[04:31.75] Oh, but can they keep it?
[04:35.15] Oh no, they can't
